# 'Algorithms for Dummies' - Chapter Exercises

These are my Jupyter Notebooks from working through the book ['Algorithms For Dummies' by John Paul Mueller & Luca Massaron](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Dummies-Computer-Tech/dp/1119330491/ref=asc_df_1119330491/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=312128454859&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4475334536145318524&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9011069&hvtargid=aud-643565131866:pla-333591608383&psc=1&sa-no-redirect=1&pldnSite=1).
They include given examples and my own exploration of the concepts presented in the text.
