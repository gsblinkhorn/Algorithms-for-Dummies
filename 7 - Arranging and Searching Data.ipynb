    "# Arranging and Searching Data\n",
    "The four data operations are create, read, update and delete (CRUD), which focus on the need to access the data you need to perform just about every task in life quickly and easily. Placing data in an order that makes it easy to perform CRUD operations is important because the less code you need to make data access work, the better. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sorted data makes searches considerably faster, as long as the sort matches the search. Sorting and searching go together: you sort the data in a way that makes searching faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different ways available to search for data. Some of these techniques are slower than others; some have attributes that make them attractive to developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of indexing (in hash maps/dictionaries) makes sorting and searching significantly faster but also comes with trade-offs that you need to consider (such as the use of additional resources).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Sorting Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining Why Sorting Data is Important\n",
    "\n",
    "When the data is unsorted, you need to search one item at a time, and you don't even know whether you'll find what you need without searching every item in the dataset first. The need to maintain several sorted orders for the same data is the reason that developers created indexes. Sorting a small index is faster than sorting the entire dataset. By maintaining an index for each sort requirement, you can effectively cut data access time and allow several people to access the data at the same time in the order in which they need to access it.\n",
    "\n",
    "When considering how effective a particular sort algorithm is at arranging data, timing benchmarks typically looks at two factors:\n",
    "- **Comparisons: ** The number of times the target data is compared against existing data in the dataset\n",
    "- **Exchanges: ** The number of times data changes place in a dataset during the sort process\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ordering Data Naively\n",
    "\n",
    "This consists of ordering data by using brute-force methods, without any regard whatsoever to making any kind of guess as to where the data should appear in the list. These approaches tend to work with the entire dataset at once (as opposed to taking a divide and conquer approach, for example), and are also relatively easy to understand while using compute resources efficently. The trade-off is that their runtime can be slower than other 'smarter' algorithms.\n",

    "A selection sort works in one of two ways: it either looks for the smallest item in the list and places it in the front of the list (ensuring that the item is in its correct location) or looks for the largest item and places it in the back of the list. \n",

    "*Worst-Case Runtime: * O(n<sup>2</sup>)\n",

    "There are two main kinds of binary heaps: a *binary max heap*, where each level of the heap contains values that are less than the previous level and the root contains the maximum key value for the tree, and a *binary min heap*, where each level of the heap contains values that are greater than the previous level and the root contains the maximum key value for the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages Over BST for Searching:**\n",
    "- Creating the required structures requires fewer resources because binary heaps can rely on arrays, making them cache friendlier as well.\n",
    "- Building a binary heap requires O(n) time, where building a BST requires O(n log n) time\n",
    "- Using pointers to implement the tree isn't necessary\n",
    "- Relying on binary heap variations (i.e. the Fibonacci Heap) offers advantages such as increase and decrease key times of O(1) time\n",

    "An interesting property of a complete tree is that we can represent it using a single list. We do not need to use nodes and references or even lists of lists. Because the tree is complete, the left child of a parent (at position p) is the node that is found in position 2p in the list. Similarly, the right child of the parent is at position 2p+1 in the list. To find the parent of any node in the tree, we can simply use Python’s integer division. Given that a node is at position n in the list, the parent is at position n/2. "
