    "# Arranging and Searching Data\n",
    "The four data operations are create, read, update and delete (CRUD), which focus on the need to access the data you need to perform just about every task in life quickly and easily. Placing data in an order that makes it easy to perform CRUD operations is important because the less code you need to make data access work, the better. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sorted data makes searches considerably faster, as long as the sort matches the search. Sorting and searching go together: you sort the data in a way that makes searching faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different ways available to search for data. Some of these techniques are slower than others; some have attributes that make them attractive to developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of indexing (in hash maps/dictionaries) makes sorting and searching significantly faster but also comes with trade-offs that you need to consider (such as the use of additional resources).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Sorting Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining Why Sorting Data is Important\n",
    "\n",
    "When the data is unsorted, you need to search one item at a time, and you don't even know whether you'll find what you need without searching every item in the dataset first. The need to maintain several sorted orders for the same data is the reason that developers created indexes. Sorting a small index is faster than sorting the entire dataset. By maintaining an index for each sort requirement, you can effectively cut data access time and allow several people to access the data at the same time in the order in which they need to access it.\n",
    "\n",
    "When considering how effective a particular sort algorithm is at arranging data, timing benchmarks typically looks at two factors:\n",
    "- **Comparisons: ** The number of times the target data is compared against existing data in the dataset\n",
    "- **Exchanges: ** The number of times data changes place in a dataset during the sort process\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ordering Data Naively\n",
    "\n",
    "This consists of ordering data by using brute-force methods, without any regard whatsoever to making any kind of guess as to where the data should appear in the list. These approaches tend to work with the entire dataset at once (as opposed to taking a divide and conquer approach, for example), and are also relatively easy to understand while using compute resources efficently. The trade-off is that their runtime can be slower than other 'smarter' algorithms.\n",

    "A selection sort works in one of two ways: it either looks for the smallest item in the list and places it in the front of the list (ensuring that the item is in its correct location) or looks for the largest item and places it in the back of the list. \n",

    "*Worst-Case Runtime: * O(n<sup>2</sup>)\n",

    "**Advantages Over BST for Searching:**\n",
    "- Creating the required structures requires fewer resources because binary heaps can rely on arrays, making them cache friendlier as well.\n",

    "## Relying on Hashing\n",
    "\n",
    "A major problem with most sorting algorithms is that they sort all the data in a dataset. When the dataset is small, you hardly notice, but as the dataset grows larger, the data movement becomes noticeable. A way around this problem is to sort just the key information. A *key* is the identifying data for a particular data record.\n",
    "\n",
    "You gain a major speed advantage by sorting the smaller amount of data presented by the keys, rather than the records as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Putting Everything into Buckets\n",
    "\n",
    "Until now, the search and sort routines presented have worked by performing a series of comparisons unitl the algorithm finds the correct value. The act of performing comparisons slows the algorithms because each comparison takes some amount of time to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "A smarter way to perform the task involves predicting the location of a particular data item in the data structure (whatever that structure might be) before actually looking for it. A *hash table* does this by providing the means to create an index of keys that points to individual items in a data structure so that an algorithm can easily predict the location of the data. The index of keys is created by a *hash function*, which converts keys into numerical values which serve as the index. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because a hash function produces repeatable results, you can easily predict the location of required data - in many cases, a hash table provides a search time of O(1).\n",
    "\n",
    "A hash table contains a specific number of *slots* that you can view as buckets for holding data. The number of filled slots when compared to the number of available slots is the *load factor*. When the load factor increases, the potential for *collisions*, where two data entries have the same hash value, increases as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the more typical methods for calculating the hash value for an input is to obtain the modulus of the value divided by the number of slots. Theoretically, if you have a perfect hash function and an infinite number of slots, every value you present to the hash function will produce a unique value (thus avoiding collisions). However, the more complex your hash function, the less benefit you receive from hashing, so keeping things simple is the best way to go. "

    "### Avoiding Collisions\n",
    "\n",
    "A problem occurs when two data entries have the same hash value. If you simply write the value into the hash table, the second entry will overwrite the first, resulting in data loss. *Collisions*, the use of the same hash value by two values, require you to have some sort of strategy in mind for handling them.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the methods for avoiding collisions is to ensure that you have a large enough hash table - keeping the load factor low is your first line of defense. However, sometimes the potential dataset is so large, but the used dataset is so small, that avoiding the problem becomes impossible. Consequently, a hash function may have to use more than just a simple modulus output to create the hash value. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Techniques for Avoiding Collisions:**\n",
    "- **Partial values:** When working with some types of information, part of that information repeats, which can create collisions. For example, the first three digits of a phone number can repeat for a given area, so removing those numbers and using just the remaining ones may solve the collision problem.\n",
    "- **Folding:** Creating a unique number might be as easy as dividing the original number into pieces, adding the pieces together, and using the result as the hash value. For example: 555-1234 -> 55 + 51 + 234 = 340\n",
    "- **Mid-Square:** The hash squares the value in question, uses some number of digits from the center of the resulting number, and discards the rest of those digits. For example: 120<sup>2</sup> = 14,400, then use 440 as the hash value\n",
    "\n",
    "There are as many ways to generate the hash function as someone has imagination. Unfortunately, no hash function can guarantee that collisions won't happen - when they do occur, you can use one of the following methods to address it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Techniques for Addressing Collisions:**\n",
    "- **Open addressing:** Your hash function stores the value in the next open slot by looking through the slots sequentially until it finds an open slot to use. The problem with this approach is that it assumes an open slot for each potential value, which may not be the case. In addition, open addressing means that the search slows considerably after the load factor increases. You can no longer find the needed value on the first comparison.\n",
    "- **Rehashing:** Your hash fuction hashes the hash value plus some constant. Consider you have a hash value of 22, a constant of 100, and a table containing 30 slots. If slot 22 already has a value, you can rehash with the function (22 + 100) % 30, which produces a new hash value of 2. In this case, you don't need to search the hash table sequentially for a value. When implemented correctly, a search might still include a low number of comparisons to find the target value. \n",
    "- **Chaining:** Each slot in the hash table can hold mulitple values. You can implement this approach by using a list within a list. Everytime a collision occurs, the code simply appends the value to the list in the target slot. This approach offers the benefit of knowing that the hash will always produce the correct slot, but the list within that slot will still require some sort of sequential (or other) search to find the specific value."

    "### Hash Functions in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "If you wonder where to find other uses of hash tables around you, check out Python's dictionaries. Dictionaries are, in fact, hash tables, even though they have a smart way to deal with collisions and you won't lose your data because two hashed keys casually have the same result. The use of a hash explains why you can't use every data type as a key - mutable data types, like lists, are unhashable.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find many examples of different hash functions in the Python `hashlib` package. It contains many algorithms, including Secure Hash Algorithms and RSA's MD5 Algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA):** These algorithms include SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384 and SHA512. Released by the National Institute of Standards and Technology as a U.S. Federal Information Processing Standard, SHA algorithms provide support for security applications and protocol.\n",
    "- **RSA's MD5 Algorithm:** Initially designed for security applications, this hash turned into a popular way to checksum files. *Checksums* reduce files to a single number that enables you to determine whether the file was modified since hash creation - they let you determine if the file you downloaded was corrupted or altered by a hacker. To ensure file integrity, just check whether the MD5 checksum of your copy corresponds to the original one communicated by the author of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can combine the output of multiple hash functions when working with complex applications that rely on a large dataset. Simply sum the results of the various outputs after having done a multiplication on or more of them. The sum of two hash functions treated in this way retains the qualities of the original hash functions even though the result is different and impossible to recover as the original elements of the sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code snippet relies on the `hashlib` package and the `md5` and `sha1` hash algorithms. You just provide a number to use for the multiplication inside the hash sum."
